        <p>While most people say we are in a great era, everyone lives in an ocean of knowledge, for there are so many resources we can learn from. 
        But I call it the desert of knowledge for two reasons.
        First, a lot of thoughts are poorly digested at the beginning, the author wouldn't or couldn't do much of polish. There are so little knowledge which is well abstracted, we can't quite get it without good abstraction, unless we pay tremendous time.  
        Second, too much noise is surrounding us, we must fight against the noise everyday to keep us from the mountain of useless information screaming at us, we have to keep calm.

        <p>With that said, I would call myself a walker in the desert of knowledge.
